~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_analytics_cmdb_endpoints" "example" {
  provider = meraki
  parameters {

    asset_tag             = "string"
    department            = "string"
    display_name          = "string"
    last_update_timestamp = 1
    location              = "string"
    mac_address           = "string"
    managed_by            = "string"
    model                 = "string"
    model_category        = "string"
    serial_number         = "string"
