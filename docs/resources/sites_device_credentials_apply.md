~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_sites_device_credentials_apply" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter
  parameters {

    device_credential_id = "string"
    site_id              = "string"
  }
}

output "dnacenter_sites_device_credentials_apply_example" {
  value = dnacenter_sites_device_credentials_apply.example
