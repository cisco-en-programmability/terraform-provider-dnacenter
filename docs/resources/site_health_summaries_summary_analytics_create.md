# dnacenter_site_health_summaries_summary_analytics_create (Resource)

It performs create operation on Sites.

- Query an aggregated summary of all site health This data source action provides the latest health data from a given
*endTime* If data is not ready for the provided endTime, the request will fail, and the error message will indicate the
recommended endTime to use to retrieve a complete data set. This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime,
since we are not a real time system. When *endTime* is not provided, the API returns the latest data. This data source
action also provides issue data. The *startTime* query param can be used to specify the beginning point of time range to
retrieve the active issue counts in. When this param is not provided, the default *startTime* will be 24 hours before
endTime.

 Aggregated response data will NOT have unique identifier data populated.

 List of unique identifier data: [*id*, *siteHierarchy*,
*siteHierarchyId*, *siteType*, *latitude*, *longitude*] Please refer to the 'API Support Documentation' section to
understand which fields are supported. For detailed information about the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API
specification document https://github.com/cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-api-

~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_site_health_summaries_summary_analytics_create" "example" {
  provider          = meraki
  id                = "string"
  site_hierarchy    = "string"
  site_hierarchy_id = "string"
  site_type         = "string"
  parameters {

    attributes = ["string"]
    end_time   = 1
    start_time = 1
    views      = ["string"]
  }
}

output "dnacenter_site_health_summaries_summary_analytics_create_example" {
  value = dnacenter_site_health_summaries_summary_analytics_create.example
}
```
