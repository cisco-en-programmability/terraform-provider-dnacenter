# dnacenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules_id (Resource)

It manages read, update and delete operations on Devices.

- API to update the maintenance schedule for the network devices. The *maintenanceSchedule* can be updated only if the
*status* value is *UPCOMING* or *IN_PROGRESS*. User can exit *IN_PROGRESS* maintenance window by setting the *endTime*
to -1. This will update the endTime to the current time and exit the maintenance window immediately. When exiting the
maintenance window, only the endTime will be updated while other parameters remain read-only.

- API to delete maintenance schedule by id. Deletion is allowed if the maintenance window is in the *UPCOMING*,
*COMPLETED*, or *FAILED* state. Deletion of maintenance schedule is not allowed if the maintenance window is currently
*IN_PROGRESS*. To delete the maintenance schedule while it is *IN_PROGRESS*, first exit the current maintenance window
using *PUT /dna/intent/api/v1/networkDeviceMaintenanceSchedules/{id}* API, and then proceed to delete the maintenance
schedule.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules_id" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter

  parameters {

    description = "string"
    id          = "string"
    maintenance_schedule {

      end_time = 1609459200
      recurrence {

        interval            = 1
        recurrence_end_time = 1.0
      }
      start_time = 1609459200
    }
    network_device_ids = ["string"]
  }
}

output "dnacenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules_id_example" {
  value = dnacenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules_id.example
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `parameters` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `item` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--item))
- `last_updated` (String)

<a id="nestedblock--parameters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Required:

- `id` (String) id path parameter. Unique identifier for the maintenance schedule

Optional:

- `description` (String) A brief narrative describing the maintenance schedule.
- `maintenance_schedule` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--maintenance_schedule))
- `network_device_ids` (List of String) List of network device ids. This field is applicable only during creation of schedules; for updates, it is read-only.

<a id="nestedblock--parameters--maintenance_schedule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters.maintenance_schedule`

Optional:

- `end_time` (Number) End time indicates the ending of the maintenance window in Unix epoch time in milliseconds.
- `recurrence` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--maintenance_schedule--recurrence))
- `start_time` (Number) Start time indicates the beginning of the maintenance window in Unix epoch time in milliseconds.

<a id="nestedblock--parameters--maintenance_schedule--recurrence"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters.maintenance_schedule.recurrence`

Optional:

- `interval` (Number) Interval for recurrence in days. The interval must be longer than the duration of the schedules. The maximum allowed interval is 365 days.
- `recurrence_end_time` (Number) The end date for the recurrence in Unix epoch time in milliseconds. Recurrence end time should be greater than maintenance end date/time.
