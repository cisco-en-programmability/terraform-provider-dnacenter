~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_icap_radios_id_stats" "example" {
  provider    = dnacenter
  id          = "string"
  xca_lle_rid = "string"
  parameters = [{

    end_time = 1
    filters = [{

      key      = "string"
      operator = "string"
      value    = 1
    }]
    page = [{

      limit           = 1
      offset          = 1
      time_sort_order = "string"
    }]
    start_time = 1
  }]
}

output "dnacenter_icap_radios_id_stats_example" {
  value = dnacenter_icap_radios_id_stats.example
}
