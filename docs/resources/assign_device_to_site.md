This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_assign_device_to_site" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter
  site_id  = "string"

    }
  }
}

output "dnacenter_assign_device_to_site_example" {
