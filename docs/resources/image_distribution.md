~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco DNA Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco DNA Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_image_distribution" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter
  parameters {
    payload {
      device_uuid = "string"
      image_uuid  = "string"
    }
  }
}

output "dnacenter_image_distribution_example" {
