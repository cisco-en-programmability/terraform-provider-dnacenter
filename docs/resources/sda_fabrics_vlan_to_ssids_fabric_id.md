# dnacenter_sda_fabrics_vlan_to_ssids_fabric_id (Resource)

It manages read and update operations on Fabric Wireless.

- Add, update, or remove SSID mappings to a VLAN. If the payload doesn't contain a 'vlanName' which has SSIDs mapping
done earlier then all the mapped SSIDs of the 'vlanName' is cleared. The request must include all SSIDs currently mapped
to a VLAN, as determined by the response from the GET operation for the same fabricId used in the request. If an
already-mapped SSID is not included in the payload, its mapping will be removed by this API. Conversely, if a new SSID
is provided, it will be added to the Mapping. Ensure that any new SSID added is a Fabric SSID. This resource can also be
used to add a VLAN and associate the relevant SSIDs with it. The 'vlanName' must be 'Fabric Wireless Enabled' and should
be part of the Fabric Site representing 'Fabric ID' specified in the API request.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_sda_fabrics_vlan_to_ssids_fabric_id" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter

  parameters {

    fabric_id = "string"
    ssid_details {

      name               = "string"
      security_group_tag = "string"
    }
    vlan_name = "string"
  }
}

output "dnacenter_sda_fabrics_vlan_to_ssids_fabric_id_example" {
  value = dnacenter_sda_fabrics_vlan_to_ssids_fabric_id.example
}
```
