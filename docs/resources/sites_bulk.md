~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_sites_bulk" "example" {
  provider = meraki
  parameters {

    address               = "string"
    country               = "string"
    floor_number          = 1
    height                = 1.0
    latitude              = 1.0
    length                = 1.0
    longitude             = 1.0
    name                  = "string"
    parent_name_hierarchy = "string"
    rf_model              = "string"
    type                  = "string"
    units_of_measure      = "string"
    width                 = 1.0
  }
}

output "dnacenter_sites_bulk_example" {
  value = dnacenter_sites_bulk.example
}
