~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_swim_image_file" "example" {
  provider                     = dnacenter
  file_name                    = "string"
  file_path                    = "string"
  is_third_party               = "false"
  third_party_application_type = "string"
  third_party_image_family     = "string"
  third_party_vendor           = "string"
