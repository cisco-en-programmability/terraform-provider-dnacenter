# dnacenter_wireless_controllers_wireless_mobility_groups_mobility_provision (Resource)

It performs create operation on Wireless.

- This data source action is used to provision/deploy wireless mobility into Cisco wireless controllers.
~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_wireless_controllers_wireless_mobility_groups_mobility_provision" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter
  parameters {

    data_link_encryption = "false"
    dtls_high_cipher     = "false"
    mac_address          = "string"
    management_ip        = "string"
    mobility_group_name  = "string"
    mobility_peers {

      device_series          = "string"
      hash_key               = "string"
      member_mac_address     = "string"
      mobility_group_name    = "string"
      peer_device_name       = "string"
      peer_ip                = "string"
      peer_network_device_id = "string"
      private_ip_address     = "string"
    }
    network_device_id = "string"
  }
}

output "dnacenter_wireless_controllers_wireless_mobility_groups_mobility_provision_example" {
  value = dnacenter_wireless_controllers_wireless_mobility_groups_mobility_provision.example
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `parameters` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `item` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--item))
- `last_updated` (String)

<a id="nestedblock--parameters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Optional:

- `data_link_encryption` (String) A secure link in which data is encrypted using CAPWAP DTLS protocol can be established between two controllers. This value will be applied to all peers during POST operation.
- `dtls_high_cipher` (String) DTLS High Cipher.
- `mac_address` (String) Device mobility MAC Address. Allowed formats are: 0a0b.0c01.0211, 0a0b0c010211, 0a:0b:0c:01:02:11
- `management_ip` (String) Self device wireless Management IP.
- `mobility_group_name` (String) Self device Group Name. Must be alphanumeric without {!,<,space,?/'} <br/> and maximum of 31 characters.
- `mobility_peers` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--mobility_peers))
- `network_device_id` (String) Obtain the network device ID value by using the API call GET: /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device/ip-address/${ipAddress}.

<a id="nestedblock--parameters--mobility_peers"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters.mobility_peers`

Optional:

- `device_series` (String) Indicates peer device mobility belongs to AireOS or IOX-XE family. 0 - indicates AireOS and 1 - indicates C9800.
- `hash_key` (String) SSC hash string must be 40 characters.
- `member_mac_address` (String) Peer device mobility MAC Address.  Allowed formats are: 0a0b.0c01.0211, 0a0b0c010211, 0a:0b:0c:01:02:11
- `mobility_group_name` (String) Peer Device mobility group Name. Must be alphanumeric without {!,<,space,?/'} <br/> and maximum of 31 characters.
- `peer_device_name` (String) Peer device Host Name.
- `peer_ip` (String) This indicates public ip address.
- `peer_network_device_id` (String) The possible values are: UNKNOWN or valid UUID of Network device Id. UNKNOWN represents out of band device which is not managed internally. Valid UUID represents WLC network device id.
- `private_ip_address` (String) This indicates private/management ip address.
