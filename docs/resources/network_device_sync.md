This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco DNA Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco DNA Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.
