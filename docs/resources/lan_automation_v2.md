~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_lan_automation_v2" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter
  parameters {

    discovered_device_site_name_hierarchy = "string"
    discovery_devices {

      device_host_name            = "string"
      device_management_ipaddress = "string"
      device_serial_number        = "string"
      device_site_name_hierarchy  = "string"
    }
    discovery_level   = 1
    discovery_timeout = 1
    host_name_file_id = "string"
    host_name_prefix  = "string"
    ip_pools {

      ip_pool_name = "string"
      ip_pool_role = "string"
    }
    isis_domain_pwd                    = "string"
    multicast_enabled                  = "false"
    peer_device_managment_ipaddress    = "string"
    primary_device_interface_names     = ["string"]
    primary_device_managment_ipaddress = "string"
    redistribute_isis_to_bgp           = "false"
  }
}

output "dnacenter_lan_automation_v2_example" {
  value = dnacenter_lan_automation_v2.example
}

## Schema

### Required

- `parameters` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `item` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--item))
- `last_updated` (String)

<a id="nestedblock--parameters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Optional:

- `payload` (Block List) Array of RequestLanAutomationLANAutomationStartV2 (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--payload))

<a id="nestedblock--parameters--payload"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters.payload`

Optional:

- `discovered_device_site_name_hierarchy` (String) Discovered device site name.
- `discovery_devices` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--payload--discovery_devices))
- `discovery_level` (Number) Level below primary seed device upto which the new devices will be LAN Automated by this session, level + seed = tier. Supported range for level is [1-5], default level is 2.
- `discovery_timeout` (Number) Discovery timeout in minutes. Until this time, the stop processing will not be triggered. Any device contacting after the provided discovery timeout will not be processed, and a device reset and reload will be attempted to bring it back to the PnP agent state before process completion. The supported timeout range is in minutes [20-10080]. If both timeout and discovery devices list are provided, the stop processing will be attempted whichever happens earlier. Users can always use the LAN Automation delete API to force stop processing.
- `host_name_file_id` (String) Use /dna/intent/api/v1/file/namespace/nw_orch API to get the file ID for the already uploaded file in the nw_orch namespace.
- `host_name_prefix` (String) Host name prefix assigned to the discovered device.
- `ip_pools` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--payload--ip_pools))
- `isis_domain_pwd` (String) IS-IS domain password in plain text.
- `multicast_enabled` (String) Enable underlay native multicast.
- `peer_device_managment_ipaddress` (String) Peer seed management IP address.
- `primary_device_interface_names` (List of String) The list of interfaces on primary seed via which the discovered devices are connected.
- `primary_device_managment_ipaddress` (String) Primary seed management IP address.
- `redistribute_isis_to_bgp` (String) Advertise LAN Automation summary route into BGP.

### Nested Schema for `parameters.payload.discovery_devices`

Optional:

- `device_host_name` (String) Hostname of the device
- `device_management_ipaddress` (String) Management IP Address of the device
- `device_serial_number` (String) Serial number of the device
- `device_site_name_hierarchy` (String) Site name hierarchy for the device, must be a child site of the discoveredDeviceSiteNameHierarchy or same if itâ€™s not area type.


<a id="nestedblock--parameters--payload--ip_pools"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters.payload.ip_pools`

Optional:

- `ip_pool_name` (String) Name of the IP pool.
- `ip_pool_role` (String) Role of the IP pool. Supported roles are: MAIN_POOL and PHYSICAL_LINK_POOL.
