~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_wireless_controllers_assign_managed_ap_locations" "example" {
  provider  = meraki
  device_id = "string"
  parameters {

    primary_managed_aplocations_site_ids   = ["string"]
    secondary_managed_aplocations_site_ids = ["string"]
  }
}

output "dnacenter_wireless_controllers_assign_managed_ap_locations_example" {
  value = dnacenter_wireless_controllers_assign_managed_ap_locations.example
}
```
