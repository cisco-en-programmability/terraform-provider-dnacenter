~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_sda_fabric_devices_layer2_handoffs_sda_transits_delete" "example" {
  provider          = meraki
  fabric_id         = "string"
  network_device_id = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_sda_fabric_devices_layer2_handoffs_sda_transits_delete_example" {
  value = dnacenter_sda_fabric_devices_layer2_handoffs_sda_transits_delete.example
