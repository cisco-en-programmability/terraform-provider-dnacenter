~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_assurance_issues_query_count" "example" {
  provider    = dnacenter
  xca_lle_rid = "string"
  parameters {

    end_time = 1
    filters {

      filters {

        key      = "string"
        operator = "string"
        value    = "string"
      }
      key              = "string"
      logical_operator = "string"
      operator         = "string"
      value            = "string"
    }
    start_time = 1
  }
}

output "dnacenter_assurance_issues_query_count_example" {
  value = dnacenter_assurance_issues_query_count.example
}
