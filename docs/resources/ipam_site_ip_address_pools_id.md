# dnacenter_ipam_site_ip_address_pools_id (Resource)

It manages read, update and delete operations on Network Settings.

- Releases an IP address subpool.
**Release** completely removes the subpool from the site, and from all child sites, and frees the address use from the
global pool(s).  Subpools cannot be released when assigned addresses in use.

- Updates an IP address subpool, which reserves address space from a global pool (or global pools) for a particular
site.
Restrictions on updating an IP address subpool: The *poolType* cannot be changed. The *siteId* cannot be changed. The
*ipV4AddressSpace* may not be removed. The *globalPoolId*, *subnet*, and *prefixLength* cannot be changed once it's
already been set. However you may edit a subpool to add an IP address space if it does not already have one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_ipam_site_ip_address_pools_id" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter

  parameters {

    id = "string"
    ip_v4_address_space {

      dhcp_servers       = ["string"]
      dns_servers        = ["string"]
      gateway_ip_address = "string"
      global_pool_id     = "string"
      prefix_length      = 1.0
      slaac_support      = "false"
      subnet             = "string"
    }
    ip_v6_address_space {

      dhcp_servers       = ["string"]
      dns_servers        = ["string"]
      gateway_ip_address = "string"
      global_pool_id     = "string"
      prefix_length      = 1.0
      slaac_support      = "false"
      subnet             = "string"
    }
    name      = "string"
    pool_type = "string"
    site_id   = "string"
  }
}

output "dnacenter_ipam_site_ip_address_pools_id_example" {
  value = dnacenter_ipam_site_ip_address_pools_id.example
}

## Schema

### Optional

- `parameters` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `item` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--item))
- `last_updated` (String)

<a id="nestedblock--parameters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Required:

- `id` (String) id path parameter. The *id* of the IP address subpool to update.

Optional:

- `ip_v4_address_space` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--ip_v4_address_space))
- `ip_v6_address_space` (Block List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--parameters--ip_v6_address_space))
- `name` (String) The name for this reserve IP pool. Only letters, numbers, '-' (hyphen), '_' (underscore), '.' (period), and '/' (forward slash) are allowed.
- `pool_type` (String) Once created, a subpool type cannot be changed.  LAN: Assigns IP addresses to LAN interfaces of applicable VNFs and underlay LAN automation.  Management: Assigns IP addresses to management interfaces. A management network is a dedicated network connected to VNFs for VNF management.  Service: Assigns IP addresses to service interfaces. Service networks are used for communication within VNFs.  WAN: Assigns IP addresses to NFVIS for UCS-E provisioning.  Generic: used for all other network types.
- `site_id` (String) The *id* of the site that this subpool belongs to. This must be the *id* of a non-Global site.

<a id="nestedblock--parameters--ip_v4_address_space"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters.ip_v4_address_space`

Optional:

- `dhcp_servers` (List of String) The DHCP server(s) for this subnet.
- `dns_servers` (List of String) The DNS server(s) for this subnet.
- `gateway_ip_address` (String) The gateway IP address for this subnet.
- `global_pool_id` (String) The non-tunnel global pool for this reserve pool (which matches this IP address type). Once added this value cannot be changed.
- `prefix_length` (Number) The network mask component, as a decimal, for the CIDR notation of this subnet.
- `slaac_support` (String) If the prefixLength is 64, this option may be enabled. Stateless Address Auto-configuration (SLAAC) allows network devices to select their IP address without the use of DHCP servers.
- `subnet` (String) The IP address component of the CIDR notation for this subnet.


<a id="nestedblock--parameters--ip_v6_address_space"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters.ip_v6_address_space`

Optional:

- `dhcp_servers` (List of String) The DHCP server(s) for this subnet.
- `dns_servers` (List of String) The DNS server(s) for this subnet.
- `gateway_ip_address` (String) The gateway IP address for this subnet.
- `global_pool_id` (String) The non-tunnel global pool for this reserve pool (which matches this IP address type). Once added this value cannot be changed.
- `prefix_length` (Number) The network mask component, as a decimal, for the CIDR notation of this subnet.
- `slaac_support` (String) If the prefixLength is 64, this option may be enabled. Stateless Address Auto-configuration (SLAAC) allows network devices to select their IP address without the use of DHCP servers.
- `subnet` (String) The IP address component of the CIDR notation for this subnet.
