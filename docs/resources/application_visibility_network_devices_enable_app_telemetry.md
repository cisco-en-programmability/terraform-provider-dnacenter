  It performs create operation on Application Policy.
  This data source action can be used to enable application telemetry feature on multiple network devices. Request
  payload should include the list of network devices where application telemetry has to be enabled. For wireless
  controllers, it also needs the WLAN modes / SSID details to be included for enablement.
  Please note that this operation can be performed even if the feature is already enabled on the network device. It would
  push the updated configurations to the network device.
  This operation pushes configuration to the network devices, and is only permitted if the provisioning settings do not
  mandate a config preview for application telemetry enablement. In cases where such settings are active, attempting to

~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_application_visibility_network_devices_enable_app_telemetry" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter
  parameters = [{

    network_devices = [{

      id                  = "string"
      include_guest_ssids = "false"
      include_wlan_modes  = ["string"]
    }]
  }]
}

output "dnacenter_application_visibility_network_devices_enable_app_telemetry_example" {
  value = dnacenter_application_visibility_network_devices_enable_app_telemetry.example
}
```
