~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco DNA Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco DNA Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_swim_image_url" "example" {
  provider = dnacenter
  parameters {
    schedule_at     = "string"
    schedule_desc   = "string"
    schedule_origin = "string"
    payload {

      application_type = "string"
      image_family     = "string"
      source_url       = "string"
      third_party      = "false"
