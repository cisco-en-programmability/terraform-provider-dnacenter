# dnacenter_maps_import (Resource)

It performs delete operation on Sites.

- Cancels a previously initatied import, allowing the system to cleanup cached resources about that import data, and
ensures the import cannot accidentally be performed / approved at a later time.
~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in DNACenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dnacenter_maps_import" "example" {
  provider            = meraki
  import_context_uuid = "string"
  parameters {

  }
}

output "dnacenter_maps_import_example" {
  value = dnacenter_maps_import.example
}
```
