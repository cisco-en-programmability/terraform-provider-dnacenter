# dnacenter Provider

The Cisco Catalyst Center provider is used to interact with Cisco Catalyst Center APIs (2.3.7.6). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.


## Example Usage

The Catalyst Center SDK client could be generated with the following parameters:

```terraform
# Configure provider with your Cisco Catalyst Center SDK credentials
provider "dnacenter" {
  # Cisco Catalyst Center user name
  username = "admin"
  # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_BASE_URL

  # Cisco Catalyst Center password
  password = "admin123"
  # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_USERNAME

  # Cisco Catalyst Center base URL, FQDN or IP
  base_url = "https://172.168.196.2"
  # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_PASSWORD

  # Boolean to enable debugging
  debug = "false"
  # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_DEBUG

  # Boolean to enable or disable SSL certificate verification
  ssl_verify = "false"
  # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_SSL_VERIFY
}
```
