## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) id path parameter. Unique id of the AAA Service. It is the combination of AAA Server IP (*serverIp*) and Device UUID (*deviceId*) separated by underscore (*_*). Example: If *serverIp* is *10.76.81.33* and *deviceId* is *6bef213c-19ca-4170-8375-b694e251101c*, then the *id* would be *10.76.81.33_6bef213c-19ca-4170-8375-b694e251101c*
- `xca_lle_rid` (String) X-CALLER-ID header parameter. Caller ID is used to trace the origin of API calls and their associated queries executed on the database. It's an optional header parameter that can be added to an API request.
