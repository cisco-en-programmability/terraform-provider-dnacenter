  It performs create operation on Policy.
  This data source action imports the given list of profiling rules. For each record, 1) If 'ruleType' for a record is
  not 'Custom Rule', then it is rejected. 2) If 'ruleId' is provided in the input record,
  2a) Record with same 'ruleId' exists in the system, then it is replaced with new data.
  2b) Record with same 'ruleId' does not exist, then it is inserted in the database.

  2b) Record with same 'ruleId' does not exist, then it is inserted in the database.
3) If 'ruleId' is not provided in the input record, then new 'ruleId' is generated by the system, and record is
inserted.
