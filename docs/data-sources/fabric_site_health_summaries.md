# dnacenter_fabric_site_health_summaries (Data Source)

It performs read operation on SDA.

- Get a paginated list of Fabric sites Networks with health summary.
This data source provides the latest health data until the given *endTime*. If data is not ready for the provided
endTime, the request will fail with error code *400 Bad Request*, and the error message will indicate the recommended
endTime to use to retrieve a complete data set. This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime, since we
are not a real time system. When *endTime* is not provided, the API returns the latest data.
For detailed information about the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API specification document
https://github.com/cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-api-specs/blob/main/Assurance/CE_Cat_Center_Org-
fabricSiteHealthSummaries-1.0.1-resolved.yaml

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dnacenter_fabric_site_health_summaries" "example" {
  provider    = dnacenter
  attribute   = "string"
  end_time    = 1609459200
  id          = "string"
  limit       = 1
  offset      = 1
  order       = "string"
  sort_by     = "string"
  start_time  = 1609459200
  view        = "string"
  xca_lle_rid = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_fabric_site_health_summaries_example" {
  value = data.dnacenter_fabric_site_health_summaries.example.items
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `xca_lle_rid` (String) X-CALLER-ID header parameter. Caller ID is used to trace the origin of API calls and their associated queries executed on the database. It's an optional header parameter that can be added to an API request.

### Optional

- `attribute` (String) attribute query parameter. The list of FabricSite health attributes. Please refer to *fabricSiteAttributes* section in the Open API specification document mentioned in the description.
- `end_time` (Number) endTime query parameter. End time to which API queries the data set related to the resource. It must be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
- `id` (String) id query parameter. The list of entity Uuids. (Ex."6bef213c-19ca-4170-8375-b694e251101c") Examples: id=6bef213c-19ca-4170-8375-b694e251101c (single entity uuid requested) id=6bef213c-19ca-4170-8375-b694e251101c&id=32219612-819e-4b5e-a96b-cf22aca13dd9&id=2541e9a7-b80d-4955-8aa2-79b233318ba0 (multiple entity uuid with '&' separator)
- `limit` (Number) limit query parameter. Maximum number of records to return
- `offset` (Number) offset query parameter. Specifies the starting point within all records returned by the API. It's one based offset. The starting value is 1.
- `order` (String) order query parameter. The sort order of the field ascending or descending.
- `sort_by` (String) sortBy query parameter. A field within the response to sort by.
- `start_time` (Number) startTime query parameter. Start time from which API queries the data set related to the resource. It must be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
- `view` (String) view query parameter. The specific summary view being requested. A maximum of 3 views can be queried at a time per request.  Please refer to *fabricSiteViews* section in the Open API specification document mentioned in the description.
