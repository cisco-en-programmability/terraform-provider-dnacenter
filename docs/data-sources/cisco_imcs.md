  It performs read operation on Cisco IMC.
  This data source retrieves the configurations of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) that have been added
  to the Catalyst Center nodes.
  The Cisco IMC configuration APIs enable the management of connections between Cisco IMC and Cisco Catalyst Center. By
  providing the Cisco IMC IP address and credentials to Catalyst Center, Catalyst Center can access and report the health
  status of hardware components within the Cisco appliance.
  More data about the Cisco IMC can be retrieved using the APIs exposed directly by Cisco IMC. Details are available in
  the Cisco IMC documentation https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/ucs-c-series-integrated-
  management-controller/series.html#~tab-documents
  The Cisco IMC configuration is relevant only for Catalyst Center deployments based on UCS appliances. In cases where
  Cisco IMC configuration is not supported by the deployment, these APIs will respond with a 404 Not Found status code.
