  It performs read operation on Site Design.
  Device Controllability is a system-level process on Catalyst Center that enforces state synchronization for some
  device-layer features. Its purpose is to aid in the deployment of required network settings that Catalyst Center needs
  to manage devices. Changes are made on network devices during discovery, when adding a device to Inventory, or when
  assigning a device to a site. If changes are made to any settings that are under the scope of this process, these
  changes are applied to the network devices during the Provision and Update Telemetry Settings operations, even if Device
  Controllability is disabled. The following device settings will be enabled as part of Device Controllability when
  devices are discovered. SNMP Credentials. NETCONF Credentials. Subsequent to discovery, devices will be added to
  Inventory. The following device settings will be enabled when devices are added to inventory. Cisco TrustSec (CTS)
  Credentials. The following device settings will be enabled when devices are assigned to a site. Some of these settings
  can be defined at a site level under Design > Network Settings > Telemetry & Wireless. Wired Endpoint Data Collection
  Enablement. Controller Certificates. SNMP Trap Server Definitions. Syslog Server Definitions. Application Visibility.
  Application QoS Policy. Wireless Service Assurance (WSA). Wireless Telemetry. DTLS Ciphersuite. AP Impersonation. If
  Device Controllability is disabled, Catalyst Center does not configure any of the preceding credentials or settings on
  devices during discovery, at runtime, or during site assignment. However, the telemetry settings and related
  configuration are pushed when the device is provisioned or when the update Telemetry Settings action is performed.
  Catalyst Center identifies and automatically corrects the following telemetry configuration issues on the device. SWIM
