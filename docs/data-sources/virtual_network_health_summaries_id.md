# dnacenter_virtual_network_health_summaries_id (Data Source)

It performs read operation on SDA.

- Get health summary for a specific Virtual Network by providing the unique virtual networks id in the url path. L2
Virtual Networks are only included in health reporting for EVPN protocol deployments. The special Layer 3 VN called
‘INFRA_VN’ is also not included for user access through Assurance virtualNetworkHealthSummaries APIS. Please find
INFRA_VN related health metrics under /data/api/v1/fabricSiteHealthSummaries (Ex: attributes
‘pubsubInfraVnGoodHealthPercentage’ and ‘bgpPeerInfraVnScoreGoodHealthPercentage’).
This data source provides the latest health data until the given *endTime*. If data is not ready for the provided
endTime, the request will fail with error code *400 Bad Request*, and the error message will indicate the recommended
endTime to use to retrieve a complete data set. This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime, since we
are not a real time system. When *endTime* is not provided, the API returns the latest data.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dnacenter_virtual_network_health_summaries_id" "example" {
  provider    = dnacenter
  attribute   = "string"
  end_time    = 1609459200
  id          = "string"
  start_time  = 1609459200
  view        = "string"
  xca_lle_rid = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_virtual_network_health_summaries_id_example" {
  value = data.dnacenter_virtual_network_health_summaries_id.example.item
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) id path parameter. unique virtual networks id
- `xca_lle_rid` (String) X-CALLER-ID header parameter. Caller ID is used to trace the origin of API calls and their associated queries executed on the database. It's an optional header parameter that can be added to an API request.

### Optional

- `attribute` (String) attribute query parameter. The interested fields in the request. For valid attributes, verify the documentation.
- `end_time` (Number) endTime query parameter. End time to which API queries the data set related to the resource. It must be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
- `start_time` (Number) startTime query parameter. Start time from which API queries the data set related to the resource. It must be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
- `view` (String) view query parameter. The specific summary view being requested. This is an optional parameter which can be passed to get one or more of the specific health data summaries associated with virtual networks.
