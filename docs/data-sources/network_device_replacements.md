# dnacenter_network_device_replacements (Data Source)

It performs read operation on Device Replacement.

- Retrieve the list of device replacements with replacement details. Filters can be applied based on faulty device name,
faulty device platform, faulty device serial number, replacement device platform, replacement device serial number,
device replacement status, device family.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dnacenter_network_device_replacements" "example" {
  provider                         = dnacenter
  family                           = "string"
  faulty_device_name               = "string"
  faulty_device_platform           = "string"
  faulty_device_serial_number      = "string"
  limit                            = 1
  offset                           = 1
  replacement_device_platform      = "string"
  replacement_device_serial_number = "string"
  replacement_status               = "string"
  sort_by                          = "string"
  sort_order                       = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_network_device_replacements_example" {
  value = data.dnacenter_network_device_replacements.example.items
}

## Schema

### Optional

- `family` (String) family query parameter. Faulty device family.
- `faulty_device_name` (String) faultyDeviceName query parameter. Faulty device name.
- `faulty_device_platform` (String) faultyDevicePlatform query parameter. Faulty device platform.
- `faulty_device_serial_number` (String) faultyDeviceSerialNumber query parameter. Faulty device serial number.
- `limit` (Number) limit query parameter. The number of records to show for this page. Maximum value can be 500.
- `offset` (Number) offset query parameter. The first record to show for this page; the first record is numbered 1.
- `replacement_device_platform` (String) replacementDevicePlatform query parameter. Replacement device platform.
- `replacement_device_serial_number` (String) replacementDeviceSerialNumber query parameter. Replacement device serial number.
- `replacement_status` (String) replacementStatus query parameter. Device replacement status. Available values : MARKED_FOR_REPLACEMENT, NETWORK_READINESS_REQUESTED, NETWORK_READINESS_FAILED, READY_FOR_REPLACEMENT, REPLACEMENT_SCHEDULED, REPLACEMENT_IN_PROGRESS, REPLACED, ERROR. Replacement status: 'MARKED_FOR_REPLACEMENT' The faulty device has been marked for replacement. 'NETWORK_READINESS_REQUESTED' Initiated steps to shut down neighboring device interfaces and create a DHCP server on the uplink neighbor if the faulty device is part of a fabric setup. 'NETWORK_READINESS_FAILED' Preparation of the network failed. Neighboring device interfaces were not shut down, and the DHCP server on the uplink neighbor was not created. 'READY_FOR_REPLACEMENT' The network is prepared for the faulty device replacement. Neighboring device interfaces are shut down, and the DHCP server on the uplink neighbor is set up. 'REPLACEMENT_SCHEDULED' Device replacement has been scheduled. 'REPLACEMENT_IN_PROGRESS' Device replacement is currently in progress. 'REPLACED' Device replacement was successful. 'ERROR' Device replacement has failed.
- `sort_by` (String) sortBy query parameter. A property within the response to sort by. Available values : id, creationTime, family, faultyDeviceId, fautyDeviceName, faultyDevicePlatform, faultyDeviceSerialNumber, replacementDevicePlatform, replacementDeviceSerialNumber, replacementTime.
- `sort_order` (String) sortOrder query parameter. Whether ascending or descending order should be used to sort the response. Available values : ASC, DESC
