# dnacenter_site_health_summaries (Data Source)

It performs read operation on Sites.

- Get a paginated list of site health summaries. Use the available query parameters to identify a subset of sites you
want health summaries for. This data source provides the latest health data from a given *endTime* If data is not ready
for the provided endTime, the request will fail, and the error message will indicate the recommended endTime to use to
retrieve a complete data set. This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime, since we are not a real time
system. When *endTime* is not provided, the API returns the latest data. This data source also provides issue data. The
*startTime* query param can be used to specify the beginning point of time range to retrieve the active issue counts in.
When this param is not provided, the default *startTime* will be 24 hours before endTime. Valid values for *sortBy*
param in this API are limited to the attributes provided in the *site* view. Default sortBy is 'siteHierarchy' in order
'asc' (ascending). For detailed information about the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API specification

If length of attribute list is too long, please use 'view' param instead.
Examples:
attribute=siteHierarchy (single attribute requested)
attribute=siteHierarchy&attribute=clientCount (multiple attributes requested)
- `end_time` (Number) endTime query parameter. End time to which API queries the data set related to the resource. It must be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
- `id` (String) id path parameter. unique site uuid
- `limit` (Number) limit query parameter. Maximum number of records to return
- `offset` (Number) offset query parameter. Specifies the starting point within all records returned by the API. It's one based offset. The starting value is 1.
- `order` (String) order query parameter. The sort order of the field ascending or descending.
- `site_hierarchy` (String) siteHierarchy query parameter. The full hierarchical breakdown of the site tree starting from Global site name and ending with the specific site name. The Root site is named "Global" (Ex. *Global/AreaName/BuildingName/FloorName*)
