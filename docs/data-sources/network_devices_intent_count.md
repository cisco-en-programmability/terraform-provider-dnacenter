# dnacenter_network_devices_intent_count (Data Source)

It performs read operation on Devices.

- API to fetch the count of network devices using basic filters. Use the */dna/intent/api/v1/networkDevices/query/count*
API if you need advanced filtering.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dnacenter_network_devices_intent_count" "example" {
  provider            = dnacenter
  family              = "string"
  id                  = "string"
  management_address  = "string"
  management_state    = "string"
  reachability_status = "string"
  role                = "string"
  serial_number       = "string"
  stack_device        = "string"
  status              = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_network_devices_intent_count_example" {
  value = data.dnacenter_network_devices_intent_count.example.item
}
