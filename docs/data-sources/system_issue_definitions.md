# dnacenter_system_issue_definitions (Data Source)

It performs read operation on Issues.

- Get all system issue defintions. The supported filters are id, name, profileId and definition enable status. An issue
trigger definition can be different across the profile and device type. So, *profileId* and *deviceType* in the query
param is important and default is global profile and all device type. For detailed information about the usage of the
API, please refer to the Open API specification document https://github.com/cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-
api-specs/blob/main/Assurance/CE_Cat_Center_Org-issueAndHealthDefinitions-1.0.0-resolved.yaml

- Get system issue defintion for the given id. Definition includes all properties from IssueTriggerDefinition schema by
default. For detailed information about the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API specification document
https://github.com/cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-api-specs/blob/main/Assurance/CE_Cat_Center_Org-

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dnacenter_system_issue_definitions" "example" {
  provider      = dnacenter
  attribute     = "string"
  device_type   = "string"
  id            = "string"
  issue_enabled = "false"
  limit         = 1
  name          = "string"
  offset        = 1
  order         = "string"
  priority      = "string"
  profile_id    = "string"
  sort_by       = "string"
  xca_lle_rid   = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_system_issue_definitions_example" {
  value = data.dnacenter_system_issue_definitions.example.items
}

data "dnacenter_system_issue_definitions" "example" {
  provider    = dnacenter
  id          = "string"
  xca_lle_rid = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_system_issue_definitions_example" {
  value = data.dnacenter_system_issue_definitions.example.item
}

## Schema

### Optional

- `attribute` (String) attribute query parameter. These are the attributes supported in system issue definitions response. By default, all properties are sent in response.
- `device_type` (String) deviceType query parameter. These are the device families/types supported for system issue definitions. If no input is made on device type, all device types are considered.
- `id` (String) id path parameter. Issue trigger definition id.
- `issue_enabled` (Boolean) issueEnabled query parameter. The enablement status of the issue definition, either true or false.
- `limit` (Number) limit query parameter. Maximum number of records to return
- `name` (String) name query parameter. The list of system defined issue names. (Ex."BGP_Down")
Examples:
name=BGP_Down (single entity uuid requested)
name=BGP_Down&name=BGP_Flap (multiple issue names separated by & operator)
- `offset` (Number) offset query parameter. Specifies the starting point within all records returned by the API. It's one based offset. The starting value is 1.
- `order` (String) order query parameter. The sort order of the field ascending or descending.
- `priority` (String) priority query parameter. Issue priority, possible values are P1, P2, P3, P4.
*P1*: A critical issue that needs immediate attention and can have a wide impact on network operations.
*P2*: A major issue that can potentially impact multiple devices or clients.
*P3*: A minor issue that has a localized or minimal impact.
*P4*: A warning issue that may not be an immediate problem but addressing it can optimize the network performance.
- `profile_id` (String) profileId query parameter. The profile identier to fetch the profile associated issue defintions. The default is *global*. Please refer Network design profiles documentation for more details.
- `sort_by` (String) sortBy query parameter. A field within the response to sort by.
- `xca_lle_rid` (String) X-CALLER-ID header parameter. Caller ID is used to trace the origin of API calls and their associated queries executed on the database. It's an optional header parameter that can be added to an API request.
