# dnacenter_fabric_summary (Data Source)

It performs read operation on SDA.

- Read Fabric summary for overall deployment. Get an aggregated summary of all fabric entities in a deployment including
the entity health.
This data source provides the latest health data until the given *endTime*. If data is not ready for the provided
endTime, the request will fail with error code *400 Bad Request*, and the error message will indicate the recommended
endTime to use to retrieve a complete data set. This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime, since we
are not a real time system. When *endTime* is not provided, the API returns the latest data.
For detailed information about the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API specification document

fabricSummary-1.0.1-oas3-resolved.yaml

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dnacenter_fabric_summary" "example" {
  provider    = dnacenter
  end_time    = 1609459200
  start_time  = 1609459200
  xca_lle_rid = "string"
}

output "dnacenter_fabric_summary_example" {
  value = data.dnacenter_fabric_summary.example.item
}
```
