## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.17 (to build the provider plugin)

## Introduction

The terraform-provider-dnacenter provides a Terraform provider for managing and automating your Cisco DNA Center environment. It consists of a set of resources and data-sources for performing tasks related to DNA Center.

This collection has been tested and supports Cisco DNA Center 2.1.1.

## Using the provider

If you are building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin) After placing it into your plugins directory, run `terraform init` to initialize it.

ex.

```hcl
  # Configure provider with your Cisco DNA Center SDK credentials
  provider "dnacenter" {
    # Cisco DNA Center user name
    # username = "admin"
    # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_BASE_URL

    # Cisco DNA Center password
    # password = "admin123"
    # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_USERNAME

    # Cisco DNA Center base URL, FQDN or IP
    # base_url = "https://172.168.196.2"
    # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_PASSWORD

    # Boolean to enable debugging
    # debug = "false"
    # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_DEBUG

    # Boolean to enable or disable SSL certificate verification
    # ssl_verify = "false"
    # it can be set using the environment variable DNAC_SSL_VERIFY
  }

  # Configure CLI credential
  resource "dna_cli_credential" "response" {
    provider = dnacenter
    item {
      username = "${var.username}"
      password = "${var.password}"
      credential_type = "APP"
    }
  }
  output "dna_cli_credential_response" {
    value = dna_cli_credential.response
  }

  # Retrieve project's templates
  data "dna_template_project" "response" {
    provider = dnacenter
    name     = "Cloud DayN Templates"
  }

  data "dna_template" "response" {
    provider   = dnacenter
    project_id = data.dna_template_project.response.items.0.id
  }
  output "dna_template_response" {
    value = data.dna_template.response
  }
```

## Building The Provider

Clone this repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/cisco-en-programmability/terraform-provider-dnacenter`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/cisco-en-programmability
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cisco-en-programmability
$ git clone https://github.com/cisco-en-programmability/terraform-provider-dnacenter.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cisco-en-programmability/terraform-provider-dnacenter
$ make build
```

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed
on your machine (version 1.15+ is _required_). You'll also need to correctly setup a
[GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary
in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-dnacenter
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create real resources.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

## Documentation

In the docs directory you can find the documentation.
